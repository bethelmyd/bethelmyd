## Hi there. ðŸ‘‹
## I'm David Bethelmy but just call me Dr. B.

I teach at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in Daytona Beach, FL.<br>
I am an Associate Professor of Computer Science. (mailto:bethelmd@erau.edu)<br>
<p>
I have been teaching for over 30 years (but not at ERAU) and I've taught almost every undergraduate course in a classic CS curriculum.<br>
Some classes that I am currently teaching are:
<ul>
<li>CS II - Java</li>
<li>Discrete Structures</li>
<li>C Programming in a Unix Environment</li>
<li>Algorithms</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I was weaned on an IBM 360/370 mainframe coding in PL/I. (This dates me terribly since I don't even know what happened to PL/I.)<br>
My first personal computer was an IBM PC with an 8086 chip and a 5 and 1/4 inch diskette drive.
